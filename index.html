				<p>Dear Eventbrite,<br><br>

				I created this webpage in order to display some of the pages I developed last summer working for Matrix Resources. As a Junior Solutions Consultant, I was assigned the task of translating mockups into HTML/CSS for the client, Windstream Communications. I did not design the pages or the assets on the pages â€“just for clarification. Additionally, the pages do not contain javascript as it was to be handled by the client. I have played with javascript before, but do not consider myself proficient at this time.<br><br>

				I have grown quite fond of web programming and am very eager to continue learning. If there is time to discuss internship opportunities further I can be reached at (770)265-6501 or by email at <a href="mailto:mbassett@uga.edu?" target="_top">mbassett@uga.edu</a>.<br><br><a href=""></a>

				Thank you again,<br><br>
