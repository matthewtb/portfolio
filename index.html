			<p>DearEventbrite,

			I created this webpage in order to display some of the pages I developed last summer working for Matrix Resources. As a Junior Solutions Consultant, I was assigned the task of translating mockups into HTML/CSS for the client, Windstream Communications. I did not design the pages or the assets on the pages â€“just for clarification. Additionally, the pages do not contain javascript as it was to be handled by the client.<br><br>

			I have grown quite fond of web programming and am very eager to continue learning. If there is an opportunity to discuss internship opportunities further I can be reached at (770)265-6501 or by email at mbassett@uga.edu.<br><br>

			Thank you again,<br><br>

			Matthew Trilby-Bassett

			<p>Disclaimer:<br><br>

			I want to apologize for the quality of this page, it was created with the intention of exhibiting as rapidly as possible.
